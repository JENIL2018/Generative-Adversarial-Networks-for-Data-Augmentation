# GANs for Data Augmentation
This project demonstrates the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data for augmenting training datasets, particularly in cases where data is scarce. GANs have gained popularity due to their ability to create realistic synthetic data, making them valuable in fields like computer vision, healthcare, and more.
## Project Overview
In this project, GANs are employed to generate synthetic data that can be used for augmenting training datasets. The generated data can be in various formats, such as images, text, or time-series data, depending on the application.
## Key Concepts:
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): A type of neural network architecture where two models (a generator and a discriminator) are trained simultaneously. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates whether the data is real or generated.

Data Augmentation: A technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by generating new synthetic samples. This is especially useful when dealing with small datasets or imbalanced classes.

## Why Use GANs for Data Augmentation?
Data Scarcity: GANs can generate realistic data samples in scenarios where collecting large amounts of real data is difficult or costly.

Improved Model Performance: Synthetic data generated through GANs can improve the robustness and generalization of machine learning models by providing additional training examples.

Applications: GANs are widely used in areas such as image synthesis, text generation, and even the creation of synthetic healthcare data for training purposes.
